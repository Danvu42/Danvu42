- Hi, I'm Dan Vu
- I'm interested in web development and computer engineering
- I'm currently learning digital design and circuit analysis, and EE 205
- I'm originally from Maui, my first UH campus was UH Maui College
- I'm a Sophomore in Computer Engineering
- I chose my major because I wanted to have a broad understanding of both electrical engineering and computer science
- A fun fact about me is that I also play guitar
- What do I wanna learn from EE 205? How to work with different developer tools and techniques, and hopefully how to work with other people
- A book I'd recommend is The Martian by Andy Weir
